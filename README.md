# What is it?
This is a Chrome extension that stops you (try, at least) to not wasting more than necessary time watching YouTube.

# Why?
Because I personally watch a lot of videos when I'm using my camera.  
I mean, 80% of my activity is on YouTube, instead of doing the useful stuff that I should be doing.  
So I thought that if I had something to remind me why I was watching the video, then maybe I would watch fewer videos.

# TUDO: 
- [x] Finding YouTube page element to add extension elements to.
- [x] Styling elements.
- [x] Make delete elements by pressing enter.
- [ ] Stop Youtube video, when MuchTube loads. 
- [ ] Storing user text.
